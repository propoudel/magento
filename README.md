# Inchoo_PHP7

PHP 7 compatibility extension for Magento 1 by Inchoo. Article with some tests and stats: http://inchoo.net/magento/its-alive/ .

## Compatibility
Tested on M CE 1.9.2.2 - 1.9.2.4. Reported working on M EE 1.14.2.2.

(CE version of extension is in master branch, and EE version is in EE branch.)

Older versions of Magento may work, but may also have other problems, not fixed by this extension.

If you can, upgrade to freshest Magento core first. If you can't, this may be a good starting point to make a branch for older versions.

Backwards compatible with PHP. Tested by us on PHP 5.6 & 5.5. Users have reported it working fine even on 5.3.3. Installing the extension before switching to PHP 7 is a good idea.

## License
MIT. (See LICENSE.txt).

## Issues
Yes. _(Of course.)_ See Issues tab. Issue reporting is welcome. Pull requests are welcome. Also, check Wiki.

## Installation
For Composer install, available on Firegento: http://packages.firegento.com/ . Because of strict Composer versioning rules, only the CE version will show up there versioned. Use dev-EE for Enterprise version. (At least for now.)

Or just download ZIP of the latest release and copy files to appropriate locations.
